##Â Toy data for BRCA genomic biomarker classification task. 

Please download this repo to your computer.

BRCA1 and BRCA2 are genes that help repair damaged DNA and suppress tumor growth. Mutations in these genes significantly increase the risk of developing breast, ovarian, and other cancers, and are therefore useful 'biomarkers'. Genetic testing can identify pathogenic variants (harmful mutations) in these genes, allowing individuals to make informed decisions about screening. Sometimes testing discovers a "Variant of Uncertain Significance" (VUS), which is a genetic change whose impact on cancer risk is currently unknown.

1) Using `train.json`, please fine-tune a model to predict the correct label(s)
2) Relevant performance metrics should be generated by predicting on `test.json` and output to a readable file
3) Your pipeline should be triggered via a `.py` file.

You do *not* need to reach any particular performance metrics! 

Please upload your code onto GitHub in a public repository and share the link. There is no need to upload your model weights.
